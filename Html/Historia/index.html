        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="450">Māori were the first to arrive in New Zealand, journeying in canoes from Hawaiki about 1,000 years ago. A Dutchman, Abel Tasman, was the first European to sight the country but it was the British who made New Zealand part of their empire.

            In 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, an agreement between the British Crown and Maori. It established British law in New Zealand and is considered New Zealand’s founding document and an important part of the country's history. The building where the treaty was signed has been preserved and, today, the Waitangi Treaty Grounds are a popular attraction.
            
            You'll find amazing Māori historic sites and taonga (treasures) - as well as beautiful colonial-era buildings - dotted throughout the country. A walk around any New Zealand city today shows what a culturally diverse and fascinating country we have become.</p>

            <h3 data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">Who is Māui?</3h>
        <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="450">According to Māori and Polynesian myths and legends, Māui was the gifted and clever demigod who won the affection of his supernatural parents after a miraculous birth and upbringing.
            He was bold and sharp-witted and taught useful arts to mankind, although he was not always liked. He tamed the sun and brought fire to the world, but one of his most famous feats was the creation of the islands we know today as Aotearoa, New Zealand. 
            Fishing up the North Island
            Māori believe that one-night Māui’s four brothers planned to go fishing and leave him behind. Overhearing their plans and not wanting to be left out, Māui hid under the floorboards of his brother’s canoe and waited until they were far away from the shore before revealing himself. He had carved a magic fishhook from an ancestors’ jawbone and he cast it deep into the sea, chanting powerful words.
            Soon, Māui realised he had caught something. Something huge! With the help of his brothers, the catch was hurled to the surface of the water. Much to their surprise, the fish they had caught was in fact a huge piece of land and they were delighted to find that they had discovered 'Te Ika a Māui' (Māui’s fish), which we know today as the North Island. 
            Before Māui had time to thank Tangaroa (the god of the sea) for the gift of this land, Māui's brothers began carving out pieces of the huge fish, creating the many valleys, mountains, and lakes that you see today on the North Island. 
            The legend of the South Island
            'Te Waka a Māui' (Māui's canoe) or what we know now as the South Island is said to be the waka or canoe that Māui and his brothers fished from. It's believed that the Kaikōura Peninsula on the east coast of the South Island is the place where the seat of the canoe was situated, where Māui stood to haul in his giant catch.
            Stewart Island-Rakiura is believed to be the anchor from the canoe and is named 'Te Punga a Māui' (Māui's anchor stone).</p>
